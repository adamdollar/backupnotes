Apple notes backup script
This is a script that I use to make an emergency backup copy of my Apple notes.  It is provided AS IS for anyone else who would like to use it.  I don't care about attachments or locked notes.  Notes are saved in html format, so recovery could be annoying.  This is intended as a last resort backup option in case I lose access to my Apple account.  Use this script at your own risk.

Since script is stored as binary, added a text version for web viewing.
